## Instructions

Race through the solar system getting credits when you beat a medal time. Use the credits to upgrade your ship.

Use Test for difficulty to open the game with all planets available and extra credits.

Use arrow keys to play, or press a button on your gamepad when you are on the course menu to use a gamepad.

All menus can be controlled by arrow keys.

## Known Issues

Course menu doesn't reset on screen resize.

Gamepad must be activated on the course screen or it won't work.

Webps need fallback in canvas.

Safari gets stuck on image.onLoad.

Please let me know if you find any more!

## TODOs and possible upgrades

Performance options:

    Option to turn off thrust / make a simpler thrust trail.

    Option to turn off background image, possibly make a simple generated background with some
    stars that would take less processor than moving a huge image.

Gamepad on menus for more seamless experience.

Max screen size so player doesn't see past background image if they are on a large screen.
Then I could get rid of the background fill and save some processing.

Option to turn on names of bodies in race for better learning experience.
Add random loading messages with different facts about each level.

Load modules with React.lazy.

Bonus level with Pluto, protoplanets and asteroids. Unlocked after beating a level,
or getting a certain amount of points.
Add point total that is the amount of credits obtained.

Third difficulty. Unlock difficulties after beating prior difficulties.

Set of easy levels and set of hard levels.

New ship / block graphics.
Type of block for long lines that don't jank when moving fast.

Create shape.js function for line of blocks that isn't straight.

Ellipse bounding box for celestial bodies that has more realistic bounce.

Add player name to some screens.
