## Known Issues

Gamepad must be activated on the course screen or it won't work.

When a gamepad is connected and player hits escape, the sound plays but the game engine still runs. Menu should show and game engine should stop.

Course menu doesn't reset on screen resize.

Webps needed in fallbacks in canvas.

Safari gets stuck on image.onLoad.

Firefox doesn't open level when it's icon is focused and player clicks again.

Please let me know if you find any more!

## TODOs

Make HUD more visible.

Option to turn on names of bodies in race for better learning experience.

Add random loading messages with different facts about each level.

Set of easy levels and set of hard levels. Bonus level with Pluto, protoplanets and asteroids. Unlocked after getting a certain amount of points.

Max screen size so player doesn't see past background image if they are on a large screen. Then I could get rid of the background fill and save some processing.

Ellipse bounding box for celestial bodies that has more realistic bounce.

Load modules with React.lazy

New ship / block graphics. Type of block for long lines that don't jank when moving fast.

Gamepad usable on menus for more seamless experience.
