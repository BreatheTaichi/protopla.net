possible performance issues

// gamepad on menus

// Change drawHUD so that static words are printed on a canvas and only changed
//      as they change.  Same with calculating which image to show, only need to
//      do that on start, then check if they changed every lap.. or not even that,
//      could call for changes once they happen.

option to turn on names of bodies in race

 pluto protoplanets(could make a level with a bunch
// of pictures of each one) asteroid belts unlocked after beating some level,
or getting a certain amount of points

add point total that is just the amount of credits obtained

// add third difficulty? make expert & extreme(?) unlock after beating prior levels

// Set of easy levels and set of hard levels
Easy version of mercury could be basically the same as the current version, but
instead of helmet spikes it's just round but with the upper planet bisecting 
the outer circle.
Could make the hard version like the original but with more narrow corridors

// make type of block for long lines that don't jank when moving fast

// create bounding box for line of blocks that isn't straight

// make ellipse bounding box for celestial bodies that has more realistic
// bounce

// fix margin on game-list-wrapper in Menu.js - doesn't change on window resize,
// leaves the course icons in weird places - style.marginLeft

// add player name to ..all? screens  Probably just Menu screens
